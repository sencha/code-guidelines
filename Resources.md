put together by Airbnb.

  - [jQuery JavaScript Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/) from jQuery
  - [A JavaScript Quality Guide](https://github.com/bevacqua/js) from Nicolas Bevacqua
  - [Compiler-Friendly Code Guidelines](http://docs.sencha.com/cmd/5.x/cmd_compiler.html) from Sencha
